To run the application load into an up to date version of android studio, you may have to ensure the java 11 is running and not 1.8. This can be done from the settings menu.
Once loaded into android studio ensure all of the correct gradle files are present and build the project. Once the project is built it can be run and tested on an emulator of your choosing.

This project would not have been possible without the help of the Kotlin and Android documentation that is found online at https://kotlinlang.org/docs/home.html and https://developer.android.com/docs respectively.
I would like to additionally acknowledge the input of the Kotlin and Android community. Their wide array of debugging tips and community questions on stack overflow made this app possible.
Finally I would like to reference Stevdza-San (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYLAirIEMMXtWOECuZAtjqQ) whos tutorials and in depth theory videos helped form the logic of this application.
